# Raven
Raven Engine reworked in C++ for better entity management in memory. Old raven engine repository will not be updated.

## Credits

The code in this repository will be largely based on the [Hazel Engine](https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel).
This repository is mostly to familiarize myself with the concepts of lower-level programming and GPU-programming.
